# Personal App / Kelsey Dickerman V-1.0.0

### Im creating this app out of the necessity for a Portfolio project. For this project you should have a basic ability to post blog posts essentially a resource dump for code and code ideas, as well as edit and delete them. I will also add to this project overtime and some future features are commented out until I find time to work on them.
